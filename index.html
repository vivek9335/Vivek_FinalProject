        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>In 1960, Tom Monaghan and his brother, James, took over the operation of DomiNick's, an existing location of
            a small pizza restaurant chain that had been owned by Dominick DeVarti, at 507 Cross Street (now 301 West
            Cross Street) in Ypsilanti, Michigan, near Eastern Michigan University. <br><br>
            The deal was secured by a $500 down payment, then the brothers borrowed $900 to pay for the store.</p>
